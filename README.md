## Chat boi - an unusal chat app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses React on the front, Firebase to store messages, displays the most recent 25. Filters profanity, replaces some words with emojis. 

`yarn && yarn start` to set it up and get it running.
